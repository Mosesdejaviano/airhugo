  title: About Us
  description: "Planet 3R is a social enterprise dedicated to converting textile and
    plastic wastes into eco-friendly products using the 3R ( Reduce, Reuse, Recycle)
    to save our planet Earth by weaving them into innovative items. \n\nWith the vision
    of creating a sustainable world without textile and plastic wastes, it became
    necessary for us at Planet 3R to reduce the landfill space by recycling clothes
    and nylons. As we know landfill sites is a threat to our environment as well as
    water supplies."

    In my quest to creating more impact, I realized many people in my community usually dump textile and plastic wastes by the roadside while some even go to the extent of burning them thereby depleting the ozone layer which is hazardous to our health and environment thus prompted me to use my weaving skills at Jokelinks to create an innovative solution by starting planet 3R initiative.

    We have been able to bridge the gap by providing solutions to the problems other existing solutions were not looking into.

    Planet 3R uses mostly digital marketing and social media platforms to market. This includes extensive promotion on Facebook, Instagram, and other relevant platforms. Planet 3R also participates in exhibitions and other forums to showcase its products.

    At Planet 3R, we not only make environmental impacts but also create employment opportunities by empowering youths. We also plan to improve our economy through locally generated raw materials and export opportunities

  title: WE BELIEVE IN GREAT IDEAS

     The global creative market is worth $1.3 trillion. African Creative Industry is worth over $4.2 billion. With over 500million Africans in Diaspora and more than 30million tourists, we are targeting 2% of the total Africa market.

    We have been able to bridge the gap by providing solutions to the problems other existing solutions were not looking into.

    Dumping of wastes on the roadside and inside drainage channels, especially single-use plastics is currently one of the biggest environmental concerns. It causes groundwater pollution, marine pollution resulting in animal deaths, and many other adverse effects on the environment.

    Our initiative focuses on the empowerment of unemployed youths by training them on effective ways to earn income from recycling plastic and textile waste.  We weave the wastes into eco-friendly products. We also engage in Grassroots and Creative Awareness programs geared Towards Achieving a Clean Environment.

    Our competitive advantage is the fact that we recycle used nylons with locally made loom while creative hub, pearl recycling makes use of plastics and foreign machinery.

    We creatively shred old clothes and used nylons (especially pure water sachets) then weave them by converting them into finished products. These finished products are fashion wear, home decors, bags, accessories, etc.
