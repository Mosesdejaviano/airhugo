    We creatively shred old clothes and used nylons (especially pure water sachets) then weave them by converting them into finished products. These finished products are fashion wear, home decors, bags, accessories, etc.

    Planet 3R uses mostly digital marketing and social media platforms to market. This includes extensive promotion on Facebook, Instagram, and other relevant platforms. Planet 3R also participates in exhibitions and other forums to showcase its products.

    Dumping of wastes on the roadside and inside drainage channels especially single-use plastics is currently one of the biggest environmental concerns. It causes groundwater pollution, marine pollution resulting in animal deaths, and many other adverse effects on the environment.
